# TCS iON RIO-125 Internship: Sales Forecasting System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for the TCS iON RIO-125 Internship project titled **"Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data"**. 
The project was completed as part of the TCS iON Remote Internship program . 
The objective is to build a forecasting system to predict product demand at a retail outlet using historical sales data.


The project involves:
- Creating and preprocessing a dataset.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify sales patterns.
- Building and evaluating forecasting models, including moving average, STL decomposition, SARIMA, and Prophet .
- 


## Repository Contents
- **`forecasting-system-Internship-Project.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code for the project, including:
  - Data loading and preprocessing (e.g., merging datasets, handling missing values).
  - Exploratory data analysis (e.g., visualizing sales trends, holiday impacts).
  - Modeling (moving average, STL, SARIMA, Prophet) and evaluation (RMSE calculations).
  - Predictions for the test period.

## Note: The notebook may not render directly on GitHub due to its size/complexity. View it on nbviewer:
